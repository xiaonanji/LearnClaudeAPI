It meets all secondary criteria: covers one full day, distributes protein well above the 150g minimum with even distribution across meals, targets appropriate caloric intake for muscle building, and includes nutrient-dense foods suitable for strength athletes. The primary deficiency is providing 6 meals when the criteria specify 4-5 meals, which contradicts the 'compact, concise' nature requested in the original task.

All meals are dairy-free and appropriate for a boxing athlete in a weight-cut phase. The plan is compact and well-formatted as a single day.
