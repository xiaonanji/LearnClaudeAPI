The carbohydrate percentage (56%) and meal timing around the afternoon long run demonstrate strong alignment with secondary criteria for endurance training. However, the incomplete dinner entry and resulting caloric discrepancy represent a material flaw that undermines confidence in the plan's accuracy. The solution is otherwise well-structured and appropriately concise, but the incomplete data prevents a higher score."

It meets all secondary criteria: covers one full day, distributes protein well above the 150g minimum with even distribution across meals, targets appropriate caloric intake for muscle building, and includes nutrient-dense foods suitable for strength athletes. The primary deficiency is providing 6 meals when the criteria specify 4-5 meals, which contradicts the 'compact, concise' nature requested in the original task. However, this is a secondary criterion violation rather than a mandatory requirement violation. The nutritional science is sound and the plan is practical and well-organized."

All meals are dairy-free and appropriate for a boxing athlete in a weight-cut phase. The plan is compact and well-formatted as a single day. The primary weakness is the incomplete hydration protocol section that cuts off mid-sentence, which is a formatting/completeness issue rather than a content deficiency. The macronutrient targets are met or nearly met (carbs slightly over, fat slightly under, but both within acceptable margins). The meal timing and composition are strategically sound for training and recovery."
